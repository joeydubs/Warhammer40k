has finished making all of its shooting attacks.
QUANTUM DEFLECTION
Necrons Stratagem
Necron quantum shielding is a true marvel of techno-arcana, phasing into existence only at the moment of impact.
Use this Stratagem when an enemy unit targets a VEHICLE in your army that has the Quantum Shielding ability, but before any hit rolls are made. Until the end of the phase, subtract 1 from rolls made for your vehicle’s Quantum Shielding ability to see if damage is ignored for
each unsaved wound.

Use this Stratagem at the start of your Movement phase. Select a <DYNASTY> INFANTRY unit from your army that is more than 1" from any enemy models and remove
it from the battlefield. Then, set the unit up again so that it is wholly within 3" of a <DYNASTY> Monolith from your army and more than 1" from any enemy models. That unit counts as having disembarked from the Monolith this turn
and can move normally.
JUDGEMENT OF THE TRIARCH
Necrons Stratagem
Those who defy the will of the Triarch are subject to swift and merciless retribution.
Use this Stratagem before a unit of Triarch Praetorians from your army shoots in the Shooting phase or fights in the Fight phase. Add 1 to hit rolls made for this unit until
the end of the phase.
GRAVITIC SINGULARITY
Necrons Stratagem
A pulsing gravitic anomaly appears in the sky over the Obelisk, dragging enemy aircraft into its crushing embrace.
Use this Stratagem at the start of your Shooting phase. Select an Obelisk from your army. When resolving this model’s Gravity Pulse ability this phase, each enemy unit within range that can FLY suffers D3 mortal wounds on a
roll of 4+, instead of a roll of 6.

Power of the C’tan of your choice.

Use this Stratagem at the end of your turn. Select a NIHILAKH unit from your army. If the unit is within 3" of an objective marker, or if it did not move for any reason during its turn, then until the start of your next turn you can add 1 to saving throws made for that unit and increase
the Attacks characteristic of models in that unit by 1.
TRANSLOCATION CRYPT
Nephrekh Stratagem
Masters of teleportation technology, the Nephrekh ride into battle upon blinding beams of light.
Use this Stratagem during deployment. You can set up a NEPHREKH INFANTRY or SWARM unit from your army in a translocation crypt instead of placing it on the battlefield. At the end of any of your Movement phases this unit can translocate into battle – set it up anywhere on the battlefield
