<h1>40k Army Builder</h1>

Disclaimer: None of the information contained within this application is owned by me. It was created by Games Workshops. This is an unofficial application to manage an army while also practicing software development.

This application is for managing an army in 40k. You can select a Unit and Wargear to add to your army.

All units in your army can be viewed in one list, which displays:
- Models in the Unit
- Stats for the Models
- Selected Wargear and stats for the gear
- Unit abilities

You can view Stratagems for your army, which are filtered to only show the ones relavent to the Units you selected.

The server instantiates an armymanager object. The server API describes the calls that can be made to the server. The server calls in turn make a call to armymanager. Please reference the armymanager API for the specific input and output expected. The server is a relay for the input an output.
